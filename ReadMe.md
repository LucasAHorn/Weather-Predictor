### Network attempts
-- 1: creating networks of random sizes, one too many bias variables, semi async
-- 2: creating networks of random sizes, fully async, using most threads on computers
-- 3: creating networks from best scoring networks from previous iterations, using all theads on my computers


### Potential improvements
-- using GPU for training
